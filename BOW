Book of work:

1) EvoX

15 - evolve code
        a - find simple examples : progteins
        b - create tRNA
        c - create subunit & mRNA
        d - create mutable DNA
        e - same for more examples
16 - select on amino acid acquisition
17 - share useful amino acids
18 - complex functions (~proteins ?) morphogenesis

For later :
X1 - select on amino acid generation ?
X2 - mutate specific regions in the code
X3 - survival when random mutation occur
X4 - viruses
X5 - teleonomical ID generation (+ formal language in EvoX ASM)

What has been done :

1 - ~13/09/2023 - can execute any program 
2 - 17/09/2023 - can self replicate (quine)
3 - 13/11/2023 - can execute some functions (function stack)
4 - 19/11/2023 - has a memory stack 
5 - 24/11/2023 - several behaviors depending on input (train, test, replicate)
6 - 28/11/2023 - can read and write free genes in the environment
7 - 28/11/2023 - can mutate a simple trait in train phase
8 - 28/11/2023 - can add free genes in environment as new functions in genome
9 - 28/11/2023 - write function as free genes in environment
10 - 30/11/2023 - teleonomical design
11 - 07/12/2023 - non regression tests for EvoX
12 - 03/01/2024 - autopoiesis and refactoring
13 - 02/02/2024 - generate "random" elementary (teleonomically speaking) functions (~amino acids ?)
14 - acquire amino acids (+ neighborhood change)
        - neighborhood change

2) Code eaters
