# General info

tRNA progteins are atomic interpretation units : given an opcode/function ID/teleonomical ID it will transcribe the RNA into teleonomical code.
After the DNA gene has been isolated into the stack as a RNA, the ribosome will transcribe the RNA sequentially into a teleonomical progtein by calling the tRNAs.
A tRNA transcribed an atomic part of the tRNA (few codons) into a molecule in the body called amino acid : at the end if k tRNA have been called we would have a final progtein composed of k amino acids.

By analogy with biology, the atomic structures that the tRNAs are concatenating in the E-site will be called progteinogenic amino acids.
